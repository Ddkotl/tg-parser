Okay, so I need to handle this task where I'm the Telegram channel editor. The user has given me a specific set of instructions that I need to follow. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to create unique content in English. If the original text isn't in English, I have to translate it. The given text is in Russian, so I'll need to translate that into English. Next, I should rephrase it to make it more engaging and lively, keeping it under 1000 characters.

I also need to remove any ads or mentions of other channels from the text. So, I'll look through the translation and make sure there are no promotional elements or references to other Telegram channels.

Keeping the essence and facts is crucial. I mustn't invent any new information, only use what's provided. I have to present this information in a beautiful design that fits the Telegram style—probably using emojis and a clean layout.

Emojis should be added to the main text but not in the title. I need to pick appropriate ones that relate to the content, like money, technology, etc. Also, I have to include 2 to 4 thematic hashtags at the end, separated by spaces.

Now, looking at the original text, it's about Kazakhstan creating a national crypto reserve. The President proposed a national digital assets fund to build a strategic crypto reserve. Digital tenge will expand to republican and local budgets. The government is to develop an investment program in high-tech economic sectors. The President wants to establish this fund under the Investment Corporation of the National Bank to consolidate the strategic crypto reserve with promising assets in the emerging digital financial ecosystem.

So, I'll translate that into English, making sure it's lively. Then, I'll structure it with emojis, maybe start with a title in bold, add some bullet points or breaks, use emojis like 💰, 🚀, etc., and end with hashtags like #Kazakhstan, #CryptoReserve, etc.

I think I need to make the title catchy and the content informative yet engaging. Avoiding any markdown, just plain text. Also, ensure the character count stays within limit.

Let me piece it together now, making sure each part flows well and the key points are highlighted.
